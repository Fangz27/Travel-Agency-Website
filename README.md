To be able to use the video as the website's background, you have to extract the video using winrar or 7z.
Next, you create a folder and name it video.
Then, you put the video you extracted inside the folder, but don't forget the html and css file has to be in a folder too, such that the folder named video is a subfolder
of the original folder. I will add images of how I did mine.

![html and css file and the video folder](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110440815/212483694-36ae3d74-cd1f-4bd2-9bab-ae1346a13882.png)
![the video name inside the folder called video](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110440815/212483700-111f0cfd-3301-46a6-aed7-4fb8865f23a7.png)
Now that is how to use the video as the background.
